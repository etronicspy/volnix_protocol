# Frontend Development Rules

## TypeScript & React
- Use strict TypeScript, define interfaces for all props/state
- Avoid `any`; use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- One component per file, co-locate related files
- Naming: Components PascalCase, hooks camelCase with `use` prefix, constants UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

## State Management
- Use React Context for global state (wallet, network)
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Create custom hooks for blockchain interactions via CosmJS
- Handle async operations with proper error handling
- Cache query results, implement retry logic

## Styling & Performance
- Use CSS Modules or styled-components
- Mobile-first approach, test on multiple screen sizes
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Lazy load routes, optimize re-renders with useMemo/useCallback
- Import only what you need, monitor bundle size

## Security
- Never store private keys in plain text
- Use secure storage (browser secure storage)
- Validate all user inputs, sanitize data before sending to blockchain
- Prevent XSS attacks, validate transaction data before signing
