# Migrations and Upgrades

## State Migrations
- Implement `AppModule.AppModuleMigrationHandler` interface
- Register migration handlers in module
- Make migrations idempotent
- Handle edge cases and missing data
- Test migrations on testnet before mainnet
- Provide rollback procedures

## Upgrade Process
- Create governance proposal for upgrades
- Register upgrade handlers in app
- Execute migrations in correct order
- Verify state after upgrade
- Handle upgrade failures gracefully

## Compatibility
- Maintain backward compatibility within major version
- Don't break existing state structure
- Add new fields as optional
- Use default values for new fields
- Document state changes

## Testing
- Test migrations on testnet with various state sizes
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Test rollback procedures
- Unit tests for migration logic, integration tests for full upgrade
