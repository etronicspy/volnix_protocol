# Git Workflow and Commit Conventions

## Commit Messages
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci
- Scope examples: `ident`, `lizenz`, `anteil`, `consensus`, `frontend`, `docs`, `proto`
- Examples: `feat(ident): add ZKP verification endpoint`, `fix(anteil): correct order matching`

## Branching
- `main`: Production-ready code, `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/<name>`, `fix/<name>`, `hotfix/<name>`, `release/<version>`
- Create feature branches from `develop`
- Keep branches focused, delete after merge

## Pull Requests
- Clear title following commit convention
- Description, link to issues, test coverage, documentation updates
- At least one approval required, all CI checks must pass
- Labels: feature, bugfix, documentation, refactor, breaking, security

## Best Practices
- Commit logical units of work, write meaningful messages
- Prefer smaller focused commits
- Use merge for feature branches, rebase for cleaning up local commits
- Don't rebase shared branches
