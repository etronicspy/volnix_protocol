# CI/CD and Automation

## CI Pipeline
- Stages: Lint, Build, Test, Security, Coverage
- Triggers: Push to any branch, PR creation/update, scheduled runs
- Run all tests, fail on failures, generate reports, upload coverage
- Parallelize tests, use test caching

## Build Process
- Install dependencies, run code generation (protobuf)
- Build binaries, run tests, create artifacts
- Artifacts: Binaries, Docker images, documentation, release packages

## Code Quality
- Linting: `golangci-lint` for Go, ESLint for frontend
- Enforce code style, fail on linting errors
- Formatting: `gofmt` for Go, Prettier for frontend

## Security Scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning, code security analysis
- Secret scanning, container image scanning
- Use `govulncheck` for Go, `npm audit` for frontend

## Deployment
- Deploy to testnet first, automated testnet deployment
- Manual mainnet deployment, rollback procedures
- Steps: Build artifacts, run smoke tests, deploy, verify, monitor

## Release Automation
- Tag releases automatically, generate changelog, create release notes
- Publish artifacts: Binary releases, Docker images, documentation

## Best Practices
- Cache dependencies, parallelize jobs, optimize build times
- Review pipelines regularly, update dependencies
- Clear error messages, retry failed steps, notify on failures
