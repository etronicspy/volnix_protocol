# Dependency Management

## Go Modules
- Use Go modules for dependency management
- Pin dependency versions in `go.mod`, use `go.sum` for checksums
- Pin Cosmos SDK: `v0.53.x`, CometBFT: `v0.38.x`
- Review dependency updates regularly, test updates before merging
- Update patch versions automatically, review major updates carefully

## Security
- Use `go list -m -u` to check for updates, `govulncheck` for vulnerability scanning
- Review security advisories, update vulnerable dependencies promptly
- Audit dependencies regularly, check for known vulnerabilities
- Minimize dependency count

## Version Management
- Use latest stable versions, avoid pre-release in production
- Test compatibility before upgrading
- Use `replace` for local development, document replace directives
- Remove replace directives before release

## Frontend Dependencies
- Use package-lock.json or yarn.lock, pin dependency versions
- Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` for security
- Fix security vulnerabilities, review dependency licenses
