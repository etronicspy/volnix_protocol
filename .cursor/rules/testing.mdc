# Testing Standards

## Test Structure
- Mirror source code structure in tests
- Use `_test.go` suffix, group related tests together
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Test functions: `Test<FunctionName>`, benchmarks: `Benchmark<FunctionName>`

## Unit Testing
- Test all public functions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Test with various inputs
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Create test helpers for common setup
- Mock external dependencies, keep tests independent

## Integration Testing
- Set up test environment, initialize test app and modules
- Test module interactions, transaction flows, state transitions
- Use `simapp` for integration tests, use `testutil` helpers
- Test with real module implementations

## End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user flows, economic scenarios, consensus mechanisms
- Set up multi-node testnet
- Configure test network, monitor test execution

## Performance Testing
- Write benchmarks for critical functions
- Run benchmarks regularly, track performance over time
- Test under load, test transaction throughput

## Best Practices
- Tests should not depend on each other
- Clean up after tests, use test isolation
- Write clear test names, use descriptive assertions
- Update tests with code changes, keep tests fast

## Frontend Testing
- Test React components, user interactions, error states
- Test wallet flows, blockchain interactions
- Test complete user journeys across browsers and devices
